# LiveJam Application

## Overview

LiveJam is an innovative application designed for musicians and bands to interact and update music chords in real-time. Leveraging the power of ChatGPT, users can easily modify chords, request key changes, and give instructions to band members, enhancing the collaboration and planning process for live performances and rehearsals.

## Features

- **Real-Time Chord Updates**: Users can update chords in real-time, allowing for dynamic collaboration during jam sessions. This is achieved after the initial request for certain conditions are made. They are then 'hardcoded' after being parsed from ChatGPT and create an editable chordsheet which can randomize chords, request changes for individual musicians (for example, someone could press a button that says 'Drums', and could have a button that says 'half time', which sends an instruction to the drummer). This way the entire band can interact. One request at a tim. 
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Utilize ChatGPT for natural language processing, enabling users to input commands and requests conversationally.
- **Interactive Commands**: Request key changes, chord alterations, and specific actions from band members, like playing in half time or incorporating triplets.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Suitable for live jam sessions or pre-planning for band practices and performances.

## How to Use

1. **Starting a Session**: Log in and start a new jam session. Invite your band members to join in.
2. **Updating Chords**: Type in your chord updates or requests in the ChatGPT interface. The changes will appear on everyoneâ€™s screen in real time.
3. **Band Member Requests**: Communicate specific instructions for band members through the chat interface. Examples include tempo changes, style suggestions, or focus areas.
4. **Session Planning**: Use LiveJam to plan out your session beforehand, outlining chord progressions and band member roles.
