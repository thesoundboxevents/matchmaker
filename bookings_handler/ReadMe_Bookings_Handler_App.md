# Bookings_Handler

## Overview
The Bookings_Handler app is the central repository for all bookings-related data within Project-Musica. It serves as the backbone for storing and managing booking information that is passed from various dashboard interfaces such as `Musician_Dash` and `Venue_Dash`.

## Features
- Centralized bookings storage: All bookings data, including dates, times, and participant information, is stored within this app.
- Data handling for bookings: Provides functionality to create, update, and delete booking records.
- Integration with user dashboards: Seamlessly receives and processes bookings data from `Musician_Dash` and `Venue_Dash`.

## Data Model
The app defines the following primary models related to bookings:

- `Booking`: The main model representing a booking, which includes fields for date, time, participants, and status.
- `Availability`: A model to track the availability of musicians and venues.

## Configuration
This section outlines the necessary configurations to ensure the Bookings_Handler app is properly set up to receive and store booking data:

- `BOOKINGS_HANDLER_SETTINGS`: A dictionary in `settings.py` containing default settings for the app, such as default booking duration and rules for cancellations.
- `DATABASE_CONFIG`: Ensure that the database configurations are optimized for write-heavy operations due to the frequent updates and insertions related to bookings.

## Security Settings
Given the sensitive nature of bookings data, appropriate security measures are in place:

- `SECURE_DATA_TRANSFER`: Set to `True` to ensure all data transfers to and from the app are encrypted.
- `DATA_RETENTION_POLICY`: Defines the time period for which bookings data is retained before being archived or deleted according to privacy regulations.

## Integration Points
The Bookings_Handler app integrates with the following components within Project-Musica:

- `Dashboards`: Receives booking requests from `Musician_Dash` and `Venue_Dash` through defined API endpoints or direct database interactions.
- `AuthenticationApp`: Works in tandem with the AuthenticationApp to ensure that all bookings are associated with authenticated users.
