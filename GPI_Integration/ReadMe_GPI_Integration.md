# GPI_Integration

## Overview
The `GPI_Integration` app is responsible for handling all interactions with General Payment Interface (GPI) services in Project-Musica. This includes processing payments, managing transactions, and interfacing with external payment systems.

## Features
- **Payment Processing**: Facilitates the processing of payments for bookings and other services within Project-Musica.
- **Transaction Management**: Manages transaction records, including tracking, validation, and reconciliation of payments.
- **External GPI Service Integration**: Interfaces with external GPI services to extend payment capabilities.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensures that all payment processes are secure and compliant with financial regulations.

## Configuration
To properly integrate GPI services, certain configurations are essential:

- `GPI_API_KEY`: API key or credentials for accessing GPI services.
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SETTINGS`: Configuration settings for each payment gateway, including API endpoints, secret keys, and other parameters.
- `TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT`: Sets the timeout duration for payment transactions to ensure prompt processing.

## Usage
Provide examples of how the `GPI_Integration` app interfaces with GPI services and other components of Project-Musica:

```python
from GPI_Integration.services import process_payment, verify_transaction

# Example usage
process_payment(user_id, booking_id, payment_details)
