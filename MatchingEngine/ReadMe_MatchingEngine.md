# MatchingEngine

## Overview
The `MatchingEngine` app is a pivotal component of Project-Musica, equipped with a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to optimize the matching of artists with venues. This ML-powered engine analyzes a range of factors to facilitate highly compatible and successful pairings.

## Features
- **ML-Powered Matching**: Leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze compatibility between musicians and venues based on historical data, preferences, and other relevant factors.
- **Customization Options**: Provides musicians and venues the ability to set detailed preferences, which are incorporated into the ML model to enhance match relevance.
- **Feedback Loop**: Utilizes feedback from past matches to continuously improve the matching algorithmâ€™s accuracy and efficiency.
- **Analytics and Insights**: Offers detailed analytics on match outcomes, trends, and user satisfaction, aiding in further refining the matching process.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Data Training**: The ML model is trained on historical booking data, user preferences, and feedback.
- **Model Updates**: Regular updates and retraining of the model to incorporate new data and user feedback.
- **Algorithm Details**: An overview of the ML algorithm used (e.g., classification, clustering, recommendation systems) and its implementation.

## Configuration
- `ML_MODEL_SETTINGS`: Configuration settings for the ML model, including parameters like learning rate, training cycle frequency, and model versioning.
- `MATCHING_CRITERIA`: Adjustable criteria used by the ML model for matching, such as genre compatibility and location proximity.

## Usage
```python
from MatchingEngine.services import find_match

# Example usage
find_match(artist_profile, venue_preferences)
